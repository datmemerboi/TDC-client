TDC Client
=

The front end system to interact with the API created by TDC([repo](https://github.com/datmemerboi/TDC)). Entire system is built on React.

**Note:** Even though all modules are completed & working, this project is still in a very rough state. Refactor & modifications will be done very soon.

## Modules
- Patient
- Treatment
- Calendar
- Invoice

## Installation
To install all packages and run the app server:
```
npm i && npm start
```

If the TDC API is running locally and the front end is to run locally as well:
```
npm i && npm run local
```
